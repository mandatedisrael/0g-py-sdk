# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-06

### üéâ Initial Working Release

This is the first fully functional version of the 0G Python SDK.

### ‚úÖ Fixed

- **Endpoint URL Bug** - Fixed missing `/v1/proxy` path in endpoint URL
  - Before: `http://provider.com:8080`
  - After: `http://provider.com:8080/v1/proxy`
  - This was causing 403 Forbidden errors from providers
  - Found by comparing with TypeScript SDK implementation

- **Account Creation** - Provider acknowledgment now auto-creates accounts
  - Previously would fail if account didn't exist
  - Now calls `transfer_fund(provider, "inference", 0)` to create account

### üöÄ Added

- Complete working example in `test.py`
- Comprehensive README with architecture deep-dive
- Quick setup guide in `SETUP.md`
- Detailed component documentation
- Request flow diagrams
- Troubleshooting section
